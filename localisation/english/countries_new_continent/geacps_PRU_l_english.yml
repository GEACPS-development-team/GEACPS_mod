However, it was dissolved by the intervention of Brazil and Argentina, and the 1870 Pacific War seemingly put an end to its possible return.\nIn recent years, there has been a surge of public sentiment in Bolivia to re-establish the Confederation; in terms of building a strong nation, this wouldn't be of any disadvantage to Peru."

However, it was dissolved by the intervention of its neighbors, and the 1870 Pacific War seemingly put an end to its possible return.

This is likely due to their defeat in the Chaco War, as well as economic and political instability."
