 CHL.4.t:0 "Project Serena is Announced"
 CHL.4.d:0 "The plan to turn Santiago into a metropolis by increasing its population was intended to concentrate national capital and accelerate public construction projects, including skyscrapers, in the area. Virtually all institutions and decisions on how to deal with political and administrative issues would become centralized, as well as even spiritual pleasures like art and entertainment. The charm and glamor of the capital, which enjoys a biased prosperity through immigration from the countryside, is appreciated by many Chileans.\nSince it's impossible to implement this plan in all Chilean provinces, each government agency was assigned one area: if the development criteria were applied to the entire, the Chile of the future wouldn't suffer from overpopulation in the capital, but instead enjoy prosperity in all of its main cities."
