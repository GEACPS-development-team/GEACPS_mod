Taking also into account the Qing Empire and Manchukuo, Puyi was the only person to be proclaimed Emperor thrice.\nAlongside Puyi's title, the country - known as \"Manchukuo\" until that point - became the \"Empire of Manchukuo\". The Era Name was also changed to \"Kangde\". At the same time, Zheng Xiaoxu, the Manchukuo Minister of the Interior, was appointed Prime Minister. The reason behind this was his high reputation amongst the Kwantung Army, as Zheng was the one who kept Puyi and the IJA in contact before the founding of the country.\nThe Kwantung Army also recommended Puyi to wear his Manchukuo Imperial Army uniform during the coronation ceremony in Hsinking, as they believed the original five-colored attire would remind the people of the \"Five Races Under One Union\" slogan.\nHowever, a Qing Dynasty-styled coronation ceremony was also held in Hsinking's Suncheon Square prior to the official one upon Puyi's request who, strongly aware of his Manchu heritage, wore the traditional Gun Long Pao (Dragon Robes). The Manchurian government later issued a statement saying that the ceremony \"didn't mean a Qing restoration\".\nThe Imperial Palace is located in the center of Hsinking, the capital of Manchuria. Initially, Puyi and his wife lived in the Jixi Building, but the government, thinking it too narrow and modest, built Tongde Hall in 1938."

This organization demanded a higher degree of autonomy from the Nationalist Government in China. Thanks to his efforts, the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Political Council was established in 1934, with Demchugdongrub as its Secretary-General.\nOn February 10, 1936, when the Mongol Military Government was established under the support of the Kwantung Army, he became its President and Commander-in-Chief. In November 1936, the Kwantung-backed Inner Mongolian Army under His Highness Prince Demchugdongrub, Li Shouxin, and Wang Ying advanced towards Suiyuan Province, but were repelled by General Fu Zuoyi. After the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, Japan sent troops to Inner Mongolia, occupying Baotou on October 17, 1937. That same month, on the 28th, Yondonwangchug, Demchugdongrub, and Li Shouxin established the Mongol United Autonomous Government in Kowa. Initially, Yondonwangchug was the leader, but when he died in March of the following year, Demchugdongrub became his successor. In October 1938, he visited Japan for the first time, being treated as a pseudo-state guest, and being awarded the Order of the Rising Sun by the Emperor. The Mongol United Autonomous Government merged with the South Chahar Autonomous Government and North Shanxi Autonomous Government on September 1, 1939, becoming the Mengjiang United Autonomous Government. Its capital located in Zhangjiakou, it was nominally an autonomous entity under Wang Jingwei's administration. In February 1941, Demchugdongrub made his second visit to Japan. In 1942, when Prime Minister Tojo invited all the leaders of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, Demchugdongrub didn't attend."

Not only did they not search and certify his reincarnation, but also tried to prevent it. After the death of Jebtsundamba VIII, the head monk of Gandantegchinlen Monastery was regarded as the Mongolian Buddhism head of faith.\nHowever, his reincarnation was to be found in Tibet, a tradition since the the times of Jebtsundamba III. In 1939, Jampal Namdrol Chokyi Gyaltsen was recognized as Jebtsundamba IX by the regent of the Central Tibetan Administration.

His family members, although small farmers, weren't peasants under a landlord or an aristocrat. They rented a small amount of their farmland to others while growing barley, buckwheat, corn, and such for themselves. It's said that they had 5 - 6 dzomos (yak-cow hybrids), about 80 sheep and goats, 2 - 3 horses, and 2 yaks. His birthplace was an ordinary house of those found anywhere in Tibet.\nHis childhood name was Lhamo Thondup, meaning \"wish-granting deity.\" His eldest brother, Thupten Jigme Norbu, had already been recognized as the incarnation of high Lama Taktser Rinpoche, studying at the famous Kumbum Monastery. His 18 years older sister was Tsering Dolma. Her mother later described him as a child who \"wasn't afraid of strangers at all.\"\nWhen he was about 3 years old, a search team was dispatched by the Tibetan government to find the latest incarnation of the Dalai Lama and, reaching Kumbum Monastery guided by various divine signs. One of these was that the body of the 13th Dalai Lama, who died in 1933, turned his head northeast during the pre-burial enshrinement period. Another was that a high Lama saw the Tibetan letters Ah, Ka, and Ma on the surface of a holy lake, followed by a three-story monastery with a turquoise roof and a path leading to a hill, from which a small house with distinctive eaves could be seen. Convinced that \"Ah\" meant \"Amdo\", they sent the search team there.\nThinking that \"Ka\" must've meant the \"K\" of \"Kumbum\", the group arrived there and discovered that the monastery had three stories and a turquoise roof, being then convinced that the vision was correct. The search team looked at the nearby village and eventually found a house with eaves on the roof.\nThe search team, led by Sera Temple's head monk \"Sera Lama\", hid their identities and entered the house. When they showed the child some of the Dalai Lama's relics, hidden amongst fakes, he chose the correct ones, saying \"That's me.\" After rigorous examination by the government and several other confirmation procedures, the three-year-old was recognized as the 13th Dalai Lama, reincarnation of Thupten Gyatso, and named Jetsun Jamphel Ngawang Lobsang Yeshe Tenzin Gyatso (Saint, Gentle Glory, Merciful, Guardian of the Faith, Ocean of Wisdom).\nIn the summer of 1939, he embarked on the three-month journey to Lhasa alongside the Tibetan government search team, his parents, and his siblings. Eventually, he entered Norbulingka (Garden of Jewels), the summer capital. In the winter of 1940, he moved into Potala Palace and officially took office as the spiritual leader of Tibet. A shaving and an apprenticeship ceremony were held at Lhasa's Jokhang Temple as he began his education as the Dalai Lama. He studied literacy with Lobsang Samten (one of his older brothers). At the same time, he started studying Buddhist chants. In addition, he began his education both as a secular (temporal) and as a spiritual (religious) ruler. When he wasn't doing that, he spent a lot of time playing with children of his age. At the age of 8, his brother Lobsang went to teach at a private school, and the Dalai Lama was educated alone, while he also spent time with his sister and sometimes his mother and brothers. He continued with his rountine of moving to Norbulingka in the early spring and returning to Potala Palace at the beginning of winter, until he was 20. During his boyhood, only about 10 Europeans lived in Lhasa, his brother Lobsang bringing one of them, Heinrich Harrer, to get to know him."

He flew to London to seek British cooperation against the German invasion of France, beginning negotiations with Winston Churchill's War Cabinet. He strongly pushed for the unification of the British-French Allied Forces command, the welcoming of exiles, and for a Franco-British Union. Heading to Bordeaux after the British decided to evacuate the French government, he lost his post when the Renault cabinet resigned due to pressure by those in favor of a ceasefire and those opposed to the Union.\nParis fell on June 15. De Gaulle decided to go into exile in the United Kindom with General Spears, a British military advisor. In London, he formed the government-in-exile of \"Free France\", using BBC Radio to call upon all Frenchmen to continue the war against Germany and their puppet in Vichy. André Dewavrin, an employee of the Rothschild-owned Banque Worms, further developed this into a proper information warfare. Using this connection, and the fact that most of Vichy minister came from this bank, De Gaulle met with Jean Moulin on October 25, 1941 and secretly sent him to mainland France to create a \"Conseil national de résistance\". In the same year, Herve Alphand became De Gaulle's economic advisor, establishing the SNPA with joint Banque Worms and Rothschild support, and \"colonel Passi\" (Dewavrin) as its auditor.\nDe Gaulle himself commanded the Free French Forces in the North Africa Campaign, centered on the Algerian and Tunisian colonies, in the battle against Germany. Still, many of the French troops in the colonies, including Indochina and Madagascar, either stayed neutral or joined to Vichy. So, the Free French Forces collaborated with the Allies to capture Gabon and Madagascar. In 1942, General Francois Darlan went over to the Allied side and became France's chief of North Africa, but was assassinated, some theories stating that De Gaulle was involved. General Henri Giraud succeeded Darlan.\nIn January 1943, the Casablanca Conference was held to decide on who would lead Free France, but was inconclusive. In May, the partisan organization Conseil national de résistance appointed De Gaulle as leader of all resisting forces, but the Committee for National Liberation, formed in Algeria in June, saw De Gaulle and Giraud as co-leaders, until  the latter resigned that November. The Committee was then reorganized into the Provisional Government of the French Republic in 1944.\nThe Allied landing operation on the European continentin Normandy in June 1944 was a success. De Gaulle returned to his homeland, leading the Free French Forces to fight alongside the Allies and liberating Paris on August 25. The following day, a triumphant return parade was held from the Arc de Triomphe of the Etoile up to Notre Dame Cathedral, the citizens of Paris filling the Champs Elysees and giving enthusiastic praise.\nAfter the liberation of France, it was decided that an interim government would rule, the Constitutional Assembly unanimously electing De Gaulle as chief of the new administration. In response, he founded the Rassemblement du Peuple Français, claiming that the Third Republic's parliamentary system had been flawed since the days of Free France, but often ignored external opinions, drawing crticism particularly from the socialist and communist parties. In economic matters, De Gaulle followed the policies ofFinance Minister Aimé Lepercq, who had been honing his skills in Eastern Europe since 1923. Finally, in October 1945, he endorsed Michel Debré's in establishing the École Nationale D'administration, smoothing the nation's disparities.

 CHARACTER_francisco_paulino_hermenegildo_teodulo_franco_bahamonde_salgado-araujo_y_pardo_de_lama_desc:0 "On March 27, 1939, just before the end of the civil war, Franco joined the Anti-Comintern Pact and, in May of the same year, left the League of Nations. Still, when World War 2 broke out that September, Franco decided that hiscountry wasn't capable of joining due to the remaining civil war devastation. Considering Germany's victories and superiority in the preliminary stages of the war, Franco abandoned complete neutrality and declared non-engagement immediately after Italy's entry into the war on June 10, 1940. Spain provided intel and supply to German and Italian ships, thereby strengthening relations with the Axis. A few days after declaring non-engagement, Spain invaded the International Zone of Tangiers and annexed it to Spanish Morocco. At the same time, Franco prepared a declaration of war against Britain in order to join in just before a British surrender, thus having a say in the peace conference that would follow. So, he tried to get Germany to approve of his territorial demands inGibraltar and North Africa in exchange of mediating an Anglo-German truce, but Adolf Hitler responded poorly to this idea.\nIn October 1940, right as the allied forces were kicked out of European continent and France was being occupied, Franco met Hitler at Hendaye. Hitler said he couldn't cede such a large part of French North Africa himself, but that it could still be possible if Britain ceded the colonial directly to Spain in the post war conference. Elated by this, Franco promised to provide a land route for the German invasion of Gibraltar, his entry into the Axis, and to join the Steel Pact. He also requested \"a vast number of strategic resources\", both military and economic, while swearing an oath of intent to enter the war.\nHowever, British dominance in the battle of Britain and in the Mediterranean front, especially in Greece, and their backing by the USA lessened Franco's pro-war fervor. He eventually declared his oath null the next year and continued to dodge requests to join the war. Still, when Hitler launched Operation Barbarossa, he gathered 10000 enthusiastic fascists from all over the country, created the Blue Division, and sent it to the Eastern Front as a volunteer unit.\nHe sent a congratulatory telegram to Japan for the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, which caused shock in the United States. However, when the Japanese invaded the Philippines, a former Spanish colony, friction arose between the two countries over how to handle the territory.\nIn 1943, when the Allies achieved complete dominance on the European and African fronts, Franco once again adopted an opportunistic stance of neutrality, and when the Blue Division was condemned by the Allies in 1944, Franco promptly promised to recall his troops, announcing that any opposition to this would be severely punished.\nIn the Pacific theater, Franco broke off diplomatic relations with Japan after the 1945 Battle of Manila, when Japanese forces were completely outnumbered, blaming the Spanish residents for their loss. \nFranco looked at World War II as follows: \"There are two completely different wars being fought. First, in Europe, against the Soviet Union, and second, in the Pacific, against Japan\". Also, \"the whole Christian world,\" including Germany, the US, and Britain, should fight against the barbaric, oriental, communist Russia as a common enemy. He followed this philosophy by mediating peace between the Allies and Germany. He stated that \"European interests in Asia should be fully restored,\" and did not consider the demands of non-Christian Japan. On July 28, 1943, when it became clear that the Axis was losing, he offered himself as a mediator to the United States, telling the U.S. Ambassador to Spain, Carlton J. H. Hayes, \"The Japanese are basically barbarians. They are imperialists of the worst kind and want to dominate China and the whole Far East. Their recent promise to guarantee independence to the Philippines is unreliable. Spain has no sympathy for Japan and would gladly cooperate with the U.S. in the Pacific war if it were not so militarily weak\". However, neither the Allies nor Germany listened to him.\nIt's said that Spanish neutrality was influenced by Antonio Salazar of neighboring Portugal, with Franco even saying about him: \"he is the most respectable and perfect politician I know”.\nAs a result, Spain acted as a \"neutral country\" during WWII, sparing itself and its colonies from the ravages of war, but its ambiguous attitude made the Allies, especially the US, suspicious."

In 1927, he was demoted to the position of Party Secretary of the Urals, but was reinstated as he was an ardent advocate of the heavy industrialization championed by Joseph Stalin and his Five-Year Plan.\nIn 1929, he returned to Moscow, where he became president of the Metallurgical Workers' Union and was elected Secretary of the Communist Party's Organization Bureau. In 1930, he became Secretary of the Central Council of the All-Workers' Union, a position he held until 1944. He was also nomnated for membership in the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1939.\nDuring World War II, Shvernik was primarily responsible for the evacuation of Western Russian industries east of the Urals, away from Nazi Germany. In 1946, after the war ended, he was elected Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the equivalent of the head of state of the Soviet Union, succeeding Mikhail Kalinin."
