 THE_GORIOUS_FAR_EAST_EMPIRE_NAME:0 "The Glorious Empire in the Far East"
 THE_GORIOUS_FAR_EAST_EMPIRE_DESC:0 "In the 16th year of Showa (1945), Japan entered a state of conflict against the United States in the Pacific. Surviving this sacred war, the Empire created the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere under the principles of Hakkou Ichiu and of an East Asian New Order.\nJapan became a land where the sun never set, but also had its fair share of problems.\nPublic distrust of party politics, rising militarism, the still-ongoing China Incident, independence movements in the colonies, the Red Empire vying to reclaim its Far East, and the Empire of Freedom secretly seeking revenge...\n\nWill the future of our country be prosperity or downfall?"
 THE_CHAOS_OF_EUROPE_NAME:0 "Europe in Chaos"
 THE_CHAOS_OF_EUROPE_DESC:0 "Europe in Chaos...\nIn the last war, the emerging Italian and German powers were successfully defeated alongside their allies. However, the actions of the victors, each moving independently, failed to build a new post-war order. The power structure which later became known as the \"Cold War\" continued to cast its shadow on the United Kingdom, France, and the Red Empire. The former First Power split into three factions, with its largest part, the South, breaking away from its control. \nEurope divided itself between Stettin in the Baltic and Trieste in the Adriatic, while a famous cross-strait conflict was starting to intensify once more..."

 CHI_THE_GORIOUS_FAR_EAST_EMPIRE_DESC:0 "The Sino-Japanese war, starting in the summer of 1937, still goes on nearly ten years later.\n\nThe Kuomintang-led central government still hasn't given up on victory in this long conflict against the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, led by the Empire of Japan. All the while, the Republic's strength as a nation has been exhausted, with the local warlords no longer willing to follow the central government's instructions.\n\nIn addition, some members of the Chinese United Front are also thinking about leaving the alliance, each country focusing on how to conserve its own strength.\n\nUnfortunately, with the diminishing influence of the Republic of China, international public opinion now believes that defeating the Sphere is no longer possible."

 JAP_THE_GORIOUS_FAR_EAST_EMPIRE_DESC:0 "The Empire of Japan won its last war against the United States of America. Before this event the \"Kingdom of Hawaii\", which held close relationship with both the Japanese and the Americans, and was sandwiched between the two, had achieved federalization with the Asian power, a concept proposed for many years.\n\nThe battle still goes on in the west, but in the north Japan has acquired North Sakhalin via a treaty with Transbaikal, which rose up against the Soviet Union. In the south, the Empire succeeded in expanding its sphere of influence to the American, British, French, and Dutch colonies through various means.\n\nThe Far East... In other words, the island nation located under the Rising Sun has become a major power within 100 years of its modernization. We now must prosper without having this sun set on us.\n\nTennoheika banzai! Dainippon Teikoku banzai!"
