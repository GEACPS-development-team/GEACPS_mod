 THE_CHAOS_OF_EUROPE_DESC:0 "Europe in Chaos...\nIn the last war, the emerging Italian and German powers were successfully defeated alongside their allies. However, the actions of the victors, each moving independently, failed to build a new post-war order. The power structure which later became known as the \"Cold War\" continued to cast its shadow on the United Kingdom, France, and the Red Empire.

In the south, the Empire succeeded in expanding its sphere of influence to the American, British, French, and Dutch colonies through various means.\n\nThe Far East... In other words, the island nation located under the Rising Sun has become a major power within 100 years of its modernization. We now must prosper without having this sun set on us.\n\nTennōheika banzai! Dainippon Teikoku banzai!"

However, the national power of the Republic of China is exhausted and the warlords are no longer willing to follow its instructions.\n\nMoreover, the members of the Chinies United Front want to leave it, each country focusing on how to best preserve its own forces.\n\nWith the Republic of China's influence declining, the international community is starting to fear that overcoming the Sphere may no longer be possible."
