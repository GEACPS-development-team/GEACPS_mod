 auto_gyro:0 "Autogyro"
 auto_gyro_desc:0 "Autogyros are aircraft that generate lift by using the force of the wind to rotate their rotor blades and move forward. Classified as rotary-wing aircraft like helicopters and Fairey Rotodynes, their blades are free and only rotate with wind from the front. Basically, as power isn't connected, vertical takeoff and hovering aren't possible with these."
 auto_gyro_tooltip:0 "Researching autogyros is a prerequisite for helicopter development. No helicopter can be developed without this technology."

 turboshaft:0 "Turboshaft Engine"
 turboshaft_desc:0 "The Turboshaft is a type of jet engine. In contrast to the normal jet engines, which use the exhaust as a propulsion method, this model extracts the shaft output from the turbine exhaust instead. Tanks and marine gas turbines both use shaft power, but only when used by aircraft it can be called a \"turboshaft\". It's used especially for helicopters."
