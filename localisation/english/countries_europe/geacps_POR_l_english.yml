With the German and Italian regimes defeated in World War II, Salazar began to stress to the West the democratic reforms taking place in Portugal. As part of that policy, he approved some democratic activities on a limited scale, resulting in the birth of the M.U.D. It could be said that the M.U.N.A.F. is continuing its insurgency under a new banner."
